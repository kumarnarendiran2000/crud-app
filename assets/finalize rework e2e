Got it! For the comment above the Manage your pensions button logic, here's a clearer and more meaningful version:

// This EE has multiple pensions, so the button label appears in plural ("Manage your pensions")
// Ensure the button is visible before interaction

Let me know if you'd prefer a shorter or more technical variation!

Got it! Here's a clearer and more meaningful version of the comment and test title, matching your intent:

it('Ensures page loaded fully and the "Manage your pension(s)" button is visible', async () => {
  // The employee (EE) has one or more pensions, so the button label may be singular or plural.
  // This button should be visible and leads to the DG Dashboard.
  const managePensionsButton = $(dashboardSelectors.managePensionsButton);
  await waitForElementToBeDisplayed(managePensionsButton);
});

Let me know if you want to include the click step and navigation assertion too.

Here’s a more clear and descriptive version of the TODO comment:

// TODO: Re-enable this test if the alert box component is reintroduced in the Dashboard UI.
// It has been commented out as the component was temporarily removed based on PO's instructions.

Let me know if you'd like to include the JIRA ticket reference or a date tag for context too.
