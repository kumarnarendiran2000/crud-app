PR Title:

Prevent Job Cancellation in Subgroups by Setting fail-fast: false in Matrix Jobs


---

PR Description:

This PR addresses the issue where a failure in one job of a matrix-based subgroup (e.g., API, Dashboard, Edge Lambda) cancels the remaining jobs prematurely in our GitHub Actions CD Package and Stage pipeline.

Fix Implemented:

Added strategy: fail-fast: false to the following matrix jobs:

upload-and-deploy-api

upload-and-deploy-dashboard

upload-and-deploy-edge-lambda



This change ensures that all jobs within a subgroup continue running and log their results independently, even if one fails.
