PR Title:

chore(dashboard): Fetch CSRF token via Ember backend using direct API call

Updated Description:

Updated frontend to fetch CSRF token from Ember backend instead of calling SLAL API directly.

Removed React Query hooks (useCsrfToken) and replaced them with a direct Axios API call to fetch the CSRF token when the logout button is clicked.

Refactored Logout.tsx and removed unnecessary dependencies on Tanstack Query.
