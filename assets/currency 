PR Description / Commit Message:

chore(hono): downgrade hono to 4.7.2 and lock version due to breaking change in AWS handler response

- Downgraded `hono` and `@hono/aws-lambda` from 4.7.5 to 4.7.2
- Removed `^` from version to prevent auto-upgrades temporarily
- This was done because newer versions of Hono return either `headers` or `multiValueHeaders` (not both)
- In our test setup, based on the mocked request, only `multiValueHeaders` is returned — causing failures where `response.headers.location` was accessed
- A backlog ticket has been created to properly upgrade and refactor the tests to use `multiValueHeaders` safely
- For now, this ensures the currency update branch passes and can proceed

Perfect — here’s a clear and professional version of your backlog ticket description and status update you can use:


---

Backlog Ticket Title:

Upgrade hono to latest version and update tests to handle multiValueHeaders


---

Description:

In the latest version of the @hono/aws-lambda package (>=4.7.3), the response returned from the handle() function includes only one of headers or multiValueHeaders, depending on the request type — not both. This change was introduced by the Hono team to align with AWS Lambda/ API Gateway response standards and avoid header duplication issues.

Currently, some of our tests rely on accessing headers via response.headers.location, which breaks due to the absence of the headers field.


---

What needs to be done:

Upgrade hono and @hono/aws-lambda to the latest version (>=4.7.5)

Refactor test cases (and any other usages) to extract values from multiValueHeaders instead:

response.multiValueHeaders?.[key]?.[0]

Optionally, introduce a helper function to abstract header access and maintain backward compatibility.



---

Status & Temporary Fix:

For now, we’ve downgraded hono from 4.7.5 to 4.7.2 in the currency update branch and removed the ^ symbol from package.json to lock the version and avoid auto-upgrades.

The fix has been pushed to the currency-update branch and handed over to Sundar for merge and continuation.

Next Steps:

This ticket is logged to track and revisit the upgrade + test refactoring work.
Let’s discuss this during sprint planning to prioritize accordingly.

Got it! Here's a simpler version of the description with your point:

Description:

In the latest version of the @hono/aws-lambda package (>=4.7.3), the response from handle() includes only one of headers or multiValueHeaders, not both.

In our tests, based on our mocked request, the response includes only multiValueHeaders. This caused failures where we were previously accessing values from response.headers.

Got it! Here's a version that keeps your natural tone but improves the flow and grammar just a bit:

Reworded version:

> Chris, actually the ticket I created — 878 — I couldn’t get a chance to bring it up in today’s sprint refinement call. I tried to jump in, but went quiet and didn’t manage to speak up properly.

I noticed you’ve already estimated it and pulled it into the upcoming sprint, so we can discuss it in tomorrow’s sprint planning when we go through the pulled-in tickets — should be fine, right?
