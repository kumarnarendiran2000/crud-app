chore(hono): downgrade hono to 4.7.2 and lock version due to breaking change in AWS handler response

- Downgraded `hono` and `@hono/aws-lambda` from 4.7.5 to 4.7.2
- Removed `^` from version to prevent auto-upgrades temporarily
- This was done because newer versions of Hono return either `headers` or `multiValueHeaders` (not both)
- In our test setup, based on the mocked request, only `multiValueHeaders` is returned â€” causing failures where `response.headers.location` was accessed
- A backlog ticket has been created to properly upgrade and refactor the tests to use `multiValueHeaders` safely
- For now, this ensures the currency update branch passes and can proceed
