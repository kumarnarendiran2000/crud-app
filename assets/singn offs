Title:

Fix E2E Test Suite Failures Due to Recent App Behavior Changes (Footer, Top Actions, Logout)


---

Description:

The existing WebDriverIO E2E test suite is currently failing due to recent functional changes in the Ember Dashboard app. Specifically:

Certain Footer links (e.g., Contact Us, FAQs, Further Support) now open in the same tab, requiring a different validation and navigation flow.

Similar adjustments are needed for Top Action links.

Logout behavior has also changed and requires test case updates to ensure it reflects the new flow.


This ticket is to update the relevant test cases to align with the current app behavior and restore a stable test state.


---

Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] All updated E2E test cases for Footer links, Top Action links, and Logout flow reflect the current application behavior

[ ] All E2E tests pass locally

[ ] Once this fix is merged, the pending GitHub Actions PR (for automated pipeline runs) can be pushed with confidence

[ ] The pipeline will run green on GitHub Actions after that PR is merged

Let me know if you want this tied to a parent epic or if you'd like me to generate subtasks for Footer, Top Links, and Logout separately!
