JIRA Ticket for CD Package & Stage Pipeline Issue


---

Project: Ember 🚀
Issue Type: Bug 🐛
Summary: CD Package & Stage Code Pipeline is Not Deploying to Staging
Description:

The CD Package & Stage Code Pipeline is expected to deploy the packaged version to the Staging environment after generating a new version. However, currently:

The pipeline only packages the code and uploads it to S3 if a new version is detected.

It does not automatically deploy the version to Staging.

As a result, the Staging environment does not reflect the latest packaged version unless a separate deployment pipeline is run.


This is inconsistent with expectations and needs correction to ensure new versions are automatically deployed to Staging once packaged.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Trigger the CD Package & Stage Code Pipeline with changes in the code.


2. Observe that a new version tag is created (if changes exist).


3. Check the S3 bucket to confirm the new version was uploaded.


4. Navigate to Staging environment and verify that the latest version is not deployed automatically.



Expected Result:

The Staging environment should be updated with the latest packaged version immediately after the pipeline runs.


Actual Result:

The pipeline only packages and uploads to S3 but does not deploy to Staging.


Severity: Medium 🟠
Impact: Staging does not get automatically updated, leading to manual deployment steps and potential delays in testing.

Suggested Fix:

Modify the CD Package & Stage Code Pipeline to automatically trigger a deployment to Staging after packaging and uploading the new version.

Ensure the correct version is deployed using the version tag uploaded to S3.
