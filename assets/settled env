3. Build and Serve the Ember Dashboard App for E2E Tests
Before building the dashboard, copy the E2E-specific environment variables using the script below:

pnpm run copy-env-test

This script copies the environments/.env.test file into .env.production.local, ensuring the correct base URL and cookie domain are injected into the build (Expo does not support direct env file injection during build).

Then, build the dashboard:

pnpm run build

Once built, serve it locally on port 8081:

pnpm serve apps/dashboard/dist -l 8081
