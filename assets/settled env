Here's the updated Step 3 for your documentation — refined and consistent with your current setup:

3. Build and Serve the Ember Dashboard App for E2E Tests
Before building the dashboard, copy the E2E-specific environment variables using the script below:

pnpm run copy-env-test

This script copies the environments/.env.test file into .env.production.local, ensuring the correct base URL and cookie domain are injected into the build (Expo does not support direct env file injection during build).

Then, build the dashboard:

pnpm run build

Once built, serve it locally on port 8081:

pnpm serve apps/dashboard/dist -l 8081

Let me know when you need a follow-up comment for the PR or reviewer response!
Absolutely! Here's the additional line you can append to the end of your PR description to reflect this update:

Update:
Refactored the env copy script to a shorter, test-specific name for clarity.
Also updated the E2E documentation under Test Execution Steps to reflect the local build-and-serve flow using this script.


Got it! Here’s the revised version in the exact flow you described:

Alright Sam, got you!

I initially kept the script in place since we’re using the same dashboard build-and-serve flow for local E2E test suite runs as well — not just in CI. As it’s relevant locally too, I’ve updated our E2E suite documentation — specifically the Test Execution Steps section — to reflect this.
Here’s the link: [insert link]

Also, as suggested, I’ve renamed the script to keep it short and make its test-specific purpose clearer. Let me know if anything else needs to be tweaked!
