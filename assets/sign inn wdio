Perfect — using this XPath selector is absolutely valid:

//*[text()="Dismiss"]

Why it works:

It matches any element (*) whose exact visible text is "Dismiss".

In your case, that targets the dismiss popup button reliably.

WebdriverIO usage:

Selector definition:

export const errorOverlaySelectors = {
  dismissButton: '//*[text()="Dismiss"]',
};

Dismiss handler in test:

const dismissBtn = await $(errorOverlaySelectors.dismissButton);
if (await dismissBtn.isDisplayed()) {
  await dismissBtn.click();
}

Bonus:

If you ever want to match partial text (like just “Dism”), you could use:

'//*[contains(text(), "Dism")]'

Let me know if you want this wrapped into a reusable utility or paired with minimized popup handling too!
