Yes, that approach makes sense. Since other API routes in the mock SLAL server verify the existence of a CK number file before returning a response, your /csrfToken endpoint should follow the same pattern.

Steps to Implement:

1. Extract CK number from the request.

This could be coming from a cookie or a request header.



2. Check if the corresponding CK file exists in the customer/ directory.

If the CK file exists, generate and return the CSRF token.

If the CK file does not exist, return 401 Unauthorized.

Modified /csrfToken Route Implementation

import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

app.get('/secure/customer-platform/rest/api/csrfToken', async (c) => {
    // Extract CK number from cookie
    const ckNumber = c.req.cookie('ck');

    // Define the path to the customer CK files
    const customerFilePath = path.join(__dirname, 'responses/api/customer', `${ckNumber}.json`);

    // If CK file does not exist, return 401 Unauthorized
    if (!ckNumber || !fs.existsSync(customerFilePath)) {
        throw new HTTPException(401, { message: 'Unauthorized: Invalid CK number' });
    }

    // Generate a CSRF token
    const csrfToken = crypto.randomUUID().replace(/-/g, '').slice(0, 32);

    // Set CSRF token as cookie
    c.header('Set-Cookie', `CSRF=${csrfToken}; Path=/; HttpOnly`);

    return c.json({ csrfToken });
});

What This Code Does:

1. Extracts the CK number from the request cookie.


2. Constructs the expected file path in the customer/ directory.


3. Checks if the CK file exists:

‚úÖ If CK file exists, it generates a CSRF token and returns it.

‚ùå If CK file is missing, it throws a 401 Unauthorized error.



4. Sets the CSRF token in a Set-Cookie header for security.

Expected Behavior:

This keeps the mock SLAL server behavior consistent with other routes while ensuring only valid users receive a CSRF token. Let me know if you need modifications! üöÄ
