Thanks for the clarity! Based on your exact requirements, here is the most accurate and maintainable approach:


---

Your Goal Recap:

You want the E2E pipeline to run on PR approval (pull_request_review).

But only if the PR includes changes under apps/dashboard/**.

Also support workflow_dispatch (manual run) and schedule (nightly).

Avoid running for unrelated PRs (e.g., backend-only changes).



---

✅ Recommended Solution: Use dorny/paths-filter

This is the cleanest and most flexible approach for your case.


---

1. Install dorny/paths-filter step early in the pipeline:

Add this job before e2e-test, name it filter:

jobs:
  filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      dashboard: ${{ steps.filter.outputs.dashboard }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - id: filter
        uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
        with:
          filters: |
            dashboard:
              - 'apps/dashboard/**'


---

2. Use the output of that filter to conditionally run e2e-test:

Update your existing e2e-test job like this:

e2e-test:
    needs: filter
    if: needs.filter.outputs.dashboard == 'true' &&
        (github.event_name != 'pull_request_review' || github.event.review.state == 'approved')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # your existing e2e-test steps here...


---

✅ This does exactly what you want:

Only runs E2E job if:

PR includes dashboard changes

and PR was approved


Also supports workflow_dispatch and schedule without changes.

Keeps your job fast and minimal for unrelated PRs.

Let me know if you want help updating your YAML – I can rewrite the block fully if needed.

Great question! If you’re using dorny/paths-filter and want scheduled or manual (workflow_dispatch) runs to always trigger, you can tweak the condition to support both.


---

Here’s how to make it work for all 3 cases:

if: |
  github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' ||
  github.event_name == 'schedule' ||
  (
    needs.filter.outputs.dashboard == 'true' &&
    github.event_name == 'pull_request_review' &&
    github.event.review.state == 'approved'
  )

Explanation:

✅ workflow_dispatch: Always allowed

✅ schedule: Always allowed

✅ pull_request_review: Only runs if:

The PR includes dashboard changes (apps/dashboard/**)

And the review state is approved




---

So your job block will look like:

jobs:
  e2e-test:
    needs: filter
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' ||
      github.event_name == 'schedule' ||
      (
        needs.filter.outputs.dashboard == 'true' &&
        github.event_name == 'pull_request_review' &&
        github.event.review.state == 'approved'
      )
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # your existing e2e test steps here...

This gives you maximum flexibility without unnecessary runs. Want me to update your full YAML?
