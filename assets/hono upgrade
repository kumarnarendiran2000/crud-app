Perfect! Here's the revised PR description with "latest version of Hono" in the beginning, without mentioning the version number upfront:

PR Title

chore: upgrade hono to latest version and refactor MoneyHub tests for multiValueHeaders compatibility


---

PR Description

> This PR upgrades the hono dependency to the latest version and refactors the MoneyHub backend handler tests to align with the updated behavior of the AWS Lambda adapter.

Background:
In the latest version of Hono, the AWS Lambda adapter was updated to return either headers or multiValueHeaders — not both — depending on the request type.
This change aligns with AWS Lambda/API Gateway response standards and helps avoid header duplication issues.

Refer to Hono PR #3883 for details:
"APIGWProxyResult should contain either of headers or multiValueHeaders, not both"

Changes Made:

Upgraded hono to the latest version

Re-added the auto-upgrade marker

Refactored MoneyHub test cases:

get-link-account.test.ts

get-complete-connection.test.ts


Updated header extraction to use:

response.multiValueHeaders?.[key]?.[0]


Why:
Our mocked Lambda responses include only multiValueHeaders, which caused failures in tests where response.headers was previously used.
