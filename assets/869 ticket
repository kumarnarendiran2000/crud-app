Yes, that's a great approach — making description and acceptance criteria imperative (e.g., "Should return...", "Must align with...") keeps them action-focused and clear. Keeping them short, implicit, and precise also helps everyone stay on the same page without too much noise.

Here’s how you can phrase them:


---

Ticket Description

The CSRF token API should return the token as a plain string, not JSON. Response content type and schema must reflect this. Header schema (for set-cookie) should also align with the actual response.


---

Acceptance Criteria

Response must be returned as text/plain with the token as raw string

OpenAPI response schema must match updated content type and format

set-cookie header should be accurately typed in the schema

Remove unused or misleading response codes (502, default)



---

For ticket comment before closing, you could say:

> Aligned the CSRF token API response with expected output — updated content type, response schema, and headers definition. Verified and merged to main. Closing this ticket.



Let me know if you want to add testing or frontend context too.
