JIRA Tech Debt Ticket

Title:

Fix Vite Build Issue Affecting Axios HTTP Adapter in Production

Description:

In the AWS environment, Axios is failing to retain the HTTP adapter, causing issues with API responses, particularly truncating the set-cookie header. This issue does not occur in local development and seems to be related to Vite’s build optimizations.

Next Steps:

Investigate why Vite removes the Axios HTTP adapter in production builds.

Apply a fix to ensure Axios handles responses correctly.

Validate in AWS deployment to confirm set-cookie headers are preserved.

Implement a long-term solution to prevent similar issues.


This ticket will be prioritized in the next sprint.

JIRA Comment Update:

All PRs for this ticket have been merged. However, after deployment, we identified an issue where API responses in AWS are not behaving as expected, specifically with the set-cookie header being truncated. This is due to Vite’s build optimizations affecting Axios, causing the HTTP adapter to be removed.

We are currently exploring workarounds to resolve this issue and will close this ticket with a temporary solution. A tech debt ticket has been created to investigate and implement a permanent fix in the next sprint. Will update once a stable workaround is identified and applied.
