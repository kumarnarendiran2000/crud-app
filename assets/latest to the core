Title:

Fix Response Manipulation Issue in AWS Due to Vite Build Optimizations

Description:

We have identified that API responses in the AWS environment are being manipulated post-deployment, specifically the set-cookie header is being truncated. This issue does not occur in local development and appears to be caused by Vite’s build optimizations.

Next Steps:

Investigate how Vite’s build process is modifying the response structure.

Identify and apply the necessary configurations or adjustments to retain the correct API response format.

Validate the fix in AWS to ensure responses match local behavior.


This issue needs to be addressed to prevent inconsistencies between local and production environments.

JIRA Comment Update:

All PRs for this ticket have been merged. However, after deployment, we observed that API responses in AWS are being manipulated, leading to the truncation of the set-cookie header. This issue does not occur in local development and seems to be caused by Vite’s build optimizations.

We are currently exploring workarounds to mitigate the issue and will close this ticket once a temporary solution is applied. A tech debt ticket has been created to investigate and implement a permanent fix in the next sprint. Will update once a stable workaround is identified and applied.
