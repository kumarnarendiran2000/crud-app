Hi Sam,

The following PRs are awaiting your review. Could you please take a look when you're available?

feat(e2e): Add GitHub Actions pipeline to run E2E test suite by Narendra_Kumar_PGH — Chris had comments which have now been addressed, and it's awaiting your closure.

feat(e2e): Integrate logger and logs capability to E2E test suite by Narendra_Kumar_PGH


Both of these PRs are related to the E2E test suite. I understand you’ve been occupied, and these are a bit old. Apologies for the delayed follow-up. If you get some time, please review them so we can get them closed.

Thanks!
