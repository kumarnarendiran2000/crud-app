"Okay, sure. Just a note—I had looked into it earlier, and Allure doesn’t have a built-in way to handle this automatically. Will keep this in mind and look into it going forward!"

This keeps it short, acknowledges the feedback, and notes your prior research without over-explaining. 🚀


Got it! Here’s the PR description rewritten cleanly without mentioning removals or moves, just like an original implementation:


---

Description

Integrated Allure reporter from @wdio/allure-reporter and the Allure command-line tool (allure-commandline).

Implemented ScreenshotReporter to capture and attach failure screenshots directly to the Allure report.

Configured Allure report generation and viewing via dedicated scripts:

generate-allure-report – Generates the Allure report from test results.

open-allure-report – Starts a local server to view the report in the browser.

Feature/Issue Validation & Testing

✔ Verified changes in local runs.

This keeps it clean, structured, and reads like an original implementation. 🚀 Let me know if you want any refinements!
