Title:

Update E2E Test Suite to Reflect Dashboard Behaviour Changes and UI Enhancements


---

Description / To Do:

Update the WebDriverIO E2E test suite to reflect recent changes in the Ember Dashboard web application and improve test reliability.

Tasks to Complete:

1. Footer & Top Action Links:

Update test logic to reflect new link behaviour (e.g., same-tab navigation).

Verify navigation and return flows are correctly handled.



2. Logout Flow:

Adjust test to reflect updated logout behaviour.

Ensure the logout button disables after click and does not redirect.



3. React Native Error Box:

Suppress the bottom-left React Native error overlay by serving a built dashboard locally.



4. Alert Box Removal:

Remove outdated alert box interactions in tests (component has been removed from UI).



5. Error Logging Enhancement:

Improve waitForElementToBeDisplayed logs to identify failing element context.



6. Footer Provider Details Fix:

Update tests to correctly assert provider-related information in the footer.



7. Dashboard CTA Label:

Update DG dashboard tests to handle singular/plural logic for the "Manage Your Pension(s)" button based on pension count.




Acceptance Criteria:

All updated test cases reflect the latest dashboard functionality.

Test suite passes locally and in CI (GitHub Actions).

Allure reports and screenshots are correctly generated and uploaded.
