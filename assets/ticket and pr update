Title:

Update E2E Test Suite to Reflect Dashboard Behaviour Changes and UI Enhancements


---

Description / To Do:

Update the WebDriverIO E2E test suite to reflect recent changes in the Ember Dashboard web application and improve test reliability.

Tasks to Complete:

1. Footer & Top Action Links:

Update test logic to reflect new link behaviour (e.g., same-tab navigation).

Verify navigation and return flows are correctly handled.



2. Logout Flow:

Adjust test to reflect updated logout behaviour.

Ensure the logout button disables after click and does not redirect.



3. React Native Error Box:

Suppress the bottom-left React Native error overlay by serving a built dashboard locally.



4. Alert Box Removal:

Remove outdated alert box interactions in tests (component has been removed from UI).



5. Error Logging Enhancement:

Improve waitForElementToBeDisplayed logs to identify failing element context.



6. Footer Provider Details Fix:

Update tests to correctly assert provider-related information in the footer.



7. Dashboard CTA Label:

Update DG dashboard tests to handle singular/plural logic for the "Manage Your Pension(s)" button based on pension count.




Acceptance Criteria:

All updated test cases reflect the latest dashboard functionality.

Test suite passes locally and in CI (GitHub Actions).

Allure reports and screenshots are correctly generated and uploaded.

Comment (for Draft PR):

Marking this PR as Draft while I work on fixing the E2E test pipeline failures triggered on this PR's approval. These failures are due to recent UI changes — refer to ticket EMBER-867 for context.

As part of this effort:

I'm updating the E2E test suite to align with the latest dashboard UI.

Additionally, I’ve found and implemented a way to serve the built dashboard instead of relying on a local dev server — this ensures better stability during tests.


I'll be creating two separate PRs:

1. One for updating the dashboard scripts to incorporate the necessary .env-related changes.


2. One for the E2E test suite improvements.



The final E2E pipeline updates will be pushed in this PR and this branch once the other changes are ready.

Currently progressing through the implementation — will update this PR and link the others once created.
