JIRA Ticket for Independent Job Execution in GitHub Actions Pipeline

Title: Prevent Job Cancellation in Subgroups of GitHub Actions Workflow

Description:
Currently, in our GitHub Actions pipeline, when one job inside a subgroup (dev, POC, pre-prod) fails, the other jobs in that subgroup get canceled abruptly, even if they are still running. This prevents a full execution report of all jobs.

We need to ensure that:
âœ… Each job inside dev, POC, pre-prod runs independently.
âœ… If one job fails, the others continue running and report pass/fail separately.
âœ… The pipeline does NOT stop execution for the entire subgroup due to a single failure.

Proposed Fix:
Modify each matrix-based job (upload-and-deploy-api, upload-and-deploy-dashboard, upload-and-deploy-edge-lambda) by adding:

strategy:
  fail-fast: false  # Ensures jobs in the same subgroup run independently

This will allow each job to complete its execution and properly log failures without canceling others.

Priority: Medium
Impact: Ensures accurate deployment reporting and prevents unnecessary job cancellations.
Affected Workflow: cd-package-and-stage-code.yml
