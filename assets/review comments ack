You can phrase your response professionally and clearly, ensuring that the reviewer understands your reasoning while also inviting further clarification if needed. Here’s a way you could respond in the PR comments:


---

Response to Reviewer:
"I have already verified both the CSRF token and the set-cookie header within the response object by using toMatchObject(mockSlalCsrfTokenResponse). Since the mock response includes both the token and headers, this assertion ensures they are correctly validated.

Would you like me to add an explicit assertion for the set-cookie header separately for better readability, or do you think the current approach suffices? Happy to adjust based on your preference!"


---

This response does two things:

1. Defends your approach by explaining that toMatchObject already covers both aspects.


2. Keeps the conversation open by asking if the reviewer still prefers a separate assertion.



This way, you acknowledge their feedback while demonstrating that you've already thought it through.

Yes, you can refine your response to also mention that you have already added the explicit verification in the route handler test. Here’s how you can phrase it professionally:

Additionally, I have explicitly asserted the set-cookie header in the route handler test, ensuring that the cookie is properly included in the response.

Would you like me to add a separate assertion for set-cookie here as well for better readability, or do you think the current approach suffices? Happy to adjust based on your preference!"

This keeps the response structured, professional, and ensures the reviewer understands that their feedback has already been addressed in another test. Let me know if you want further refinements!
