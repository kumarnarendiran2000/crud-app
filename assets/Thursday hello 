Tests should cover all response scenarios.
CI workflow must pass with environment variables properly configured.

Comment 1 — Work Explanation

Implemented integration tests for the Feedback API. Since the endpoint communicates with a third-party Rant & Rave service (which lacks a test env), we mocked the API using our local SLAL server.

Key changes made:

Created mock route in SLAL to mimic various Rant & Rave responses (200, 400, 500)

Configured api.config.json to point Ember to mock SLAL for local/test env

Updated CI pipeline to load required secrets via system environment variables (SECRETS_RANTANDRAVE)

Wrote Pactum-based integration tests to validate:

202 for valid feedback submission

400 for schema validation failures

500 for internal error simulation

Comment 2 — Status Update

Two PRs have been raised:

1. Mock SLAL route and config setup


2. Integration test and CI pipeline updates



Both are currently under peer review. Will mark the ticket as Done once reviews are complete and changes are merged.
