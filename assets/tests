Since there are multiple scenarios related to logout testing, we can structure the Test Result Evidence Report efficiently without unnecessary repetition.

How to Group Scenarios in the Report?

1. Group all scenarios under a single test section

Since all tests are logout-related, we can have one "Logout Functionality Test Summary" instead of repeating sections for each scenario.



2. Use a single "Test Steps" table for all scenarios

Add a column for "Scenario Name" so that all steps are listed together while still maintaining clarity.



3. Defects Section (Even if None Found)

Leave the Defects Section empty or mention "No defects found".

Updated Structure for the Report

1. Logout Functionality Test Summary


---

2. Test Data (If applicable)


---

3. Test Steps


---

4. Defects (If Any)


---

5. Screenshots or Logs

Attach any screenshots or logs showing successful logout behavior.



---

Why This Structure?

✅ No repetition → We avoid repeating "Test Summary" for each scenario.
✅ All steps in one table → Makes it easy to track execution.
✅ Scenarios are clearly separated → Each test step belongs to a scenario for clarity.
✅ Defects only if needed → If there are no defects, the table remains empty.
